# My First Mini Game Project

⚠️ **Disclaimer: This was my first project, and the code quality reflects that.**  
Everything is written in a single file, the architecture is poor, and the code can be hard to follow. If I were to build this again, I would refactor it into multiple files, use proper classes, and organize the logic better.

### Why am I sharing this?
- To show my learning progress.
- To keep it as a reminder of my first completed project.
- Maybe someone will find some value in the approach or the initial idea.

### Should you use this as a base for your own project?
❌ I don’t recommend it.  
✅ But if you’re curious about what a beginner project looks like without polish — feel free to explore.

---

I’ll publish more polished and structured projects in the future.  
This one stays here as a part of my learning journey.
